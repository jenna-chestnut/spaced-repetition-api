# Ehl - Spaced Repetition API
## Learn new French words, with the spaced repetition technique! 

---

Ehl is an app created to demonstrate a possible platform for learning new words in a specified language. 

Learners start with a word, and the more often they correctly guess the translation, the less often they will see that word. If they guess incorrectly, the word will begin to show itself more frequently.

This is accomplished using a linked list data structure and spaced repetition in the server-side app. COnditional rendering on the client shows the results of their guess, scores, and the correct translation (or next word, if they have guess correctly!)
